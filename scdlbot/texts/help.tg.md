Hi! I download and send audios from videos/tracks/sets/albums in *MP3 128 kbps* with tags and artwork.
• Send or forward a message containing links in my PM and I will download immediately.
• Send or forward a message containing links in groups with me and I will ask you.
• [Privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) is _disabled_, so I scan every group message for links.
• `/dl <links>` to download immediately.
• `/link <links>` to get only direct download URLs.
• /clutter to toggle replies and spam captions on / off.
• Files over 50 MB (bot-sent size limit) are split into parts.
• Supported links and resources:
*SoundCloud*: tracks/playlists/pages with private widgets
*Bandcamp*: tracks/albums/custom links
*YouTube*: videos/playlists
*Mixcloud, Vimeo and* [everything from this list](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html) (no VK music)

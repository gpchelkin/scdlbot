Hi! I download and send *audios* of tracks/sets/albums/videos/playlists from free streaming websites in *MP3* format with tags and artwork.

*Usage:*
_Send or forward_ a text message containing links and I will:
• In *Download* mode: download every link I support (or you may use a direct command `/dl <links>`)
• In *Links* mode: show direct download URLs for every link (or you may use a direct command `/link <links>`)
• In *Ask* mode: scan for supported links and ask you to choose what to do with them: download or get links
• Use /settings to select working mode for messages sent *without direct command* (simple messages with links).
• Use /settings to toggle *Captions*.
• [Privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#privacy-mode) is _disabled_, so that I scan every group message.
• Supported links and streaming websites:
- *SoundCloud*: tracks/playlists/pages with private widgets
- *Bandcamp*: tracks/albums/custom links
- *YouTube*: videos/playlists/_not_ lives
- *Mixcloud, Vimeo and* [pretty much everything from this list](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md) if you enable *Unknown sites*, but no VK Music

*Example message with links:*
`Hey, check this out! https://m.soundcloud.com/falling-ethics/jk-flesh-static-demon-fexelvn004 and also https://shitmat.bandcamp.com/track/amen-babylon-2016-mix and youtu.be/Mdzy5RKn434`
